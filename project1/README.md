Game Slot Machine:
Tyler K. Yim


Timeframes

Day 1: Define Game Concepts & Set Up Environment
    -Decide on the theme and visual style of the slot machine
    -Outline the basic rules and features (number of reels, symbols, win conditions)
    -setup developer environment
    -create a new project folder
    -setup basic HTML file with a DOM element
    -Create Javasript file for game logic

Day 2: Design Game Elements:
-Design Symbols
    -create or find images for the slot machine symbols
    -decide on the payout values for each symbol
-Create Reel Layout 

Day 3: Implement Game Logic
    Set Up Reels
    1.Write Javascript functions to initilize and spin the reels
    -Display intiial symbols on the canvas
    2. Handle User Input:
    Implement User Controls for Spinning the Reels

Day 4: Add Animation    
    1. Animate Reel Spinning
    -Add Smooth animations to stimulate spinning reels
    
Day 5: Implement Win Conditions
    1. Determine Win Lines:
    Define Winning Combinations and Paylines
    2. Calculate Payouts:
    -Write functions to calculate and display winnings

Day 6: Enhance User Experience 
    1. Implement UI Enhancements:
    -Add a user interface for displaying credits, bet amounts and winnings.
    -include buttons for adjusting bet & spinning
    2. Optimize for Mobile
    -ensure the game is responsive and playable on different devices.

Day 7: Test, Debug, and Deploy
    1. Test the Game
    -Playtest the game to identify and fix bugs
    -Test on Different Browsers and Ensure compatability 
    2. Debug and Refine
    -user Browser developer tools for debugging
    -refine game elements based on feedback

    3. Deploy Game
    -Host game local Github
    -share the link with others to gather feedback

-Check for Responsive Design
-Documentation to add comments to GA Team
-Accessibility

Steps & Checklist Plan to Create Game - Slot Machine 
Installation Instructions 

 Implement Game Logic
    - Write Javascript Functions to handle game mechanics
    -Manage Player input (Keyboard or mouse events)
    -Implement Game States (Start, Play, End)

Create the Game Loop
    - Set Up a game loop to continuously update and render the game 
    - manage frame rate and thinking

Handle Collision Detection 
    -Implement collision detection for interactions between game elements
    -handle collisions based on the rules on your game

Add Visuals
    -Include html & css
    -enhance visuals with CSS styles or graphics

Implement Score & Feedback
    -track and display the player's score or progress
    -Provide feedback to the player, such as Notifications or animations

Test & Debug
    -test the game to identify and fix bugs
    -use browser, developer tools for debuggin

Optimize and Refine:
    -Optimize yoru code for better performance
    -Refine game elements based on playtesting and feedback

Deploy the Game
    -Host game to local github
    -committing the code

Document the Code:
    -create documentation

----------------
Technologies & Resources: I will be using

Chatgpt to help me construct the plan framework of the video game and for simple questions.

FreecodeCamps - to see examples of others using and building similar games to see what ideas inspire my own

CodeProject: I will utilize to see other inspired as a board for game projects and to see what I can find that are similar to the Game I will be creating.

GitHub: There will be other projects I will be researched to see the logic breakdown for my own research.

Dev: Another forum to see other inspiring projects.

youtube.com: I will watch videos to see how other people constructed similar games and try to create the logic that comes into this breakdown. 

APIS - https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis

ProgrammableWeb: - API for random number generation and for related to gaming and win or loss outcome..

User Stories
User Stories are the who are the users, what do they want, and why?

Who: 
    1. Recreational Users: Gamers that want  simple trial and quick gaming experience
    2. Online Gamers: Individuals who enjoy playing on the web and want to test out the UX/ UI or luck.
    3. Recreational Gamblers: Users that are familiar with entertainment of gambling and want to try and seek out if they can outsmart the Game Logic.

What: 
    1. Entertainment / Recreation: Users play the slot machine for a break or roulette sim
    
    2. Chance & Luck - The game has an element of luck and it allows for users to try out their luck or break or outsmart the game logic.

    3. Visual Appeal - Use of the slot and winnings to see how the lines connect

    4Gambling Aspect - Understanding the game of slots or the win or loss conditions.

Why:

    1. Pattern Recognition - They are familiar with Slot Machines and want to see what it can do
    2. Fun & Logic - understanding of the slots and what the win or loss conditions are
    3. Nostaglia or Stress Relief  - simple game for positive and negative outcomes that users will use to kill time and reminiscent the game at a different environment.

 Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles
    1. Major hurdles are going to be putting the API and the logic to work correctly through the debugging and errors
    2. Research is going to take some time as what the correct way or other examples of this game
    3. User Interface responsiveness with the buttons that work with prompting the player is going to take some work
    4. Having the game logic complexity down with possible spinning reels that has the winning combinations, it maybe chonky or chunky.
    5. Being the first app I am coding it is going to be difficult but is going to be an exciting time. 

    Getting Help
    I will be asking for help from the GA instructors frequently to see what is right, debugging, or understanding logic.
    Watching old videos for understanding concepts from class and how to apply them into our project.
